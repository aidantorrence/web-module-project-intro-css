        <h1>Yosemite Park Guide</h1>
        <p>Come explore California’s beautiful wilderness.</p>
        <p>Always open. Reservations are not available or required to enter the park.</p>
        
        <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
        
        <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>
